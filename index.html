                    "Our self-driving cars are being hit surprisingly often by other drivers who are distracted and not
                    paying attention to the road," wrote Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car project, in
                    the blog post. "The clear theme is human error and inattention" in those incidents. Google is
                    testing a fleet of 23 specially equipped Lexus prototypes, and said it has logged more than 1
                    million test miles. Last month, the company began testing tiny, bubble-shaped self-driving prototype
                    vehicles of its own design on public roads around Mountain View.

                    Last yearâ€™s General Motors Co. ignition-switch fiasco helped push the total number of recalls in the
                    U.S. to 64 million cars, more than double the previous record. Then Honda Motor Co. paid $70 million
                    for failing to properly report death, injury and warranty data to U.S. regulators. This month,
                    Takata Corp., the maker of faulty airbags linked to seven deaths and 100 injuries in the U.S.,
                    agreed to a civil penalty that could reach $200 million, an all-time-high. That was the third time
                    this year a misbehaving company paid a record-breaking fine to auto-safety regulators. Trucking
                    fatalities are also increasing.

                    The Clubsport gets Porsche's 3.8-liter flat-six engine making 385 hp and features a six-speed
                    dual-clutch transmission. A mechanical limited-slip diff divides power in back while its front axle is
                    taken from the 911 GT3 Cup car. Also from the GT3, the Clubsport uses a lightweight strut suspension
                    with transverse arms in the rear. Steel brake discs measure 15 inches all around with six-piston
                    calipers in front and four-piston calipers in the rear.
